# Keeper-App

This is A Keeper Web App basically, a clone of Google Keep. In Which you can add your note and you can also delete your note by pressing delete function.
I didn't add database to it, it is just a frontend web app, so data will be lost when you refresh your website.
I used ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Javascript ES6 to build it.
Concepts of ReactJs used in building this project are Map function, filter function, arrow function, conditional rendaring, useState Hooks, array destructing, react form, and managing complex states.
I have used Material UI in this project.
